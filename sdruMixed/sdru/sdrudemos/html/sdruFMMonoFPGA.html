%% FPGA Targeting with USRP(R) N210 Hardware 
% This example shows how to add code to the FPGA in USRP(R) N210 hardware
% that implements FM demodulation from Simulink.  You will generate HDL
% code and implement it on the FPGA using the HDL Coder workflow advisor.
%
% This example relies on the digital downconverter (DDC) already present in
% the FPGA within the USRP(R) N210.

%% Requirements
% * Simulink(R)
% * HDL Coder(TM)
% * USRP(R) N210 motherboard with WBX or TVRX daughter card connected to
% your computer
% * Xilinx ISE Tools installed
%
%% About FPGA Targeting with USRP(R) N210 
%
% This example shows you how to prototype the baseband algorithms on FPGA
% with real-time hardware. You may also use this workflow to speed up your
% Simulink simulations with real-time hardware.
%
% The following may be noted about this workflow:
%
%%
% # This workflow only applies to single-channel receivers that use the
% digital downconverter (DDC) already present in the FPGA within the
% USRP(R) N210.  This example will not change the existing DDC code.
% # FPGA code for transmit paths and additional receive paths will not
% be present in the USRP(R) FPGA. This allows more FPGA area for
% implementation of baseband algorithms from Simulink.
%% Model the FM Demodulator for HDL 
%
load_system('sdruFMMonoFPGA');
open_system('sdruFMMonoFPGA/FM Receiver');
set_param('sdruFMMonoFPGA', 'SimulationCommand', 'update');
%%
% The example model <matlab:sdruFMMonoFPGA sdruFMMonoFPGA> shows how FM
% Demodulator can be modeled for HDL code generation and implementation on
% FPGA. The original model <matlab:sdruFMMono sdruFMMono> can be converted
% to its new form as follows:
%% 
%
% * Convert to Sample-Based  - You must model the |FM_Demod_FPGA| subsystem 
% intended for HDL code generation in sample based manner for scalar
% processing. You can convert the frame based input signals to scalar by
% using Unbuffer block. To get back to frame based mode you can use Buffer
% block. Within this boundary of Unbuffer/Buffer blocks, the system
% operates in scalar mode and is good for HDL Code generation.
%
% * Convert to Fixed Point - The complex I/Q baseband signal input to FM
% Demodulator is converted to fixed point with 16 bit word length and 17
% bit fraction length. The FM demodulator is implemented as a complex
% difference operation between consecutive complex samples. Arctan is
% implemented using cordic in parallel with 8 stages and a latency of 10.
%
% * Conform to USRP(R) FPGA Interface - The output of FM Demodulator must
% be two 16 bits signed signals in order to match the output of existing
% digital down converter in the FPGA. This is done by modeling another
% subsystem |FPGA to host| (not shown above) within |FM_Demod_FPGA| which
% converts the 32 bit FM Demodulator output to 16 bit complex integers.
%
%% Simulation Model of Baseband Algorithm in Real Time
%%
% You can simulate the model with real time data from hardware to verify
% your baseband algorithm in Simulink. Buffering may be enabled for the
% SDRu Receiver block to ensure that the samples are contiguous for a
% specified number of frames. 
%%
% To enable buffering for this example:
%
% # Open SDRu Receiver block mask
% # Check box for *Enable burst mode*
% # Enter 1000 for the *Number of frames in burst*
%
% You can simulate this model in accelerator mode to verify that the fixed
% point FM Demodulator model plays the FM radio to the tuned frequency. You
% will notice that the model plays for small segments with pauses in
% between, when the SDRu Receiver block pauses for buffering the next burst
% of data.
%
%% Generate HDL and Implement on FPGA
%
% <<sdrufmmonohdlwfa.png>>
%
%%
% You can follow the step by step instructions to generate HDL for
% subsystem |FM_Demod_FPGA|:
%%
% # Open the workflow by right-clicking on |FM_Demod_FPGA| subsystem and
% select HDL Code and HDL Workflow Advisor.
% # On step 1.1 select *Customization for the USRP(R) Device* for *Target
% workflow* and your USRP(R) N210 Board for *Target Platform*
% # Run steps 2.1 to 2.5 to make sure your model is compatible.
% # On step 3.1, select the HDL Code generation options. Specifically on
% step 3.1.2 select *Synchronous* for Reset type, *Active-high* for *Reset
% asserted level* and *Single* for *Clock  inputs*. These HDL options are
% set so as to match with the rest of USRP(R) FPGA code.
% # On step 3.2 select *Generate RTL Code*
% # On step 4.0 *Generate FPGA Implementation*, *USRP(R) Source File Folder*
% is already populated with the path to USRP(R) FPGA root directory. 
% The relevant USRP(R) FPGA code was downloaded during the installation
% from Ettus Research(TM) UHD(TM) Mirror site.
%%
% By running step 4.0, the HDL Workflow Advisor creates a new Xilinx ISE project
% and adds the following:
%%
% * All the necessary files from the USRP(R) FPGA repository
% * The generated HDL files for |FM_Demod_FPGA| subsystem.
%
%%
% If no error is found in FPGA project generation and syntax checking, FPGA
% programming file generation process will start in an external command
% shell. You can monitor the external shell for the progress of
% implementation processes. A message indicating successful completion of
% programing file generation is printed out in the shell upon completion.
%
%% Burn FPGA with New Bit Stream
% You can burn the generated FPGA binary using the burner utility, as 
% provided by Ettus Research(TM) and as per the instructions in 
% Firmware Update section of <../../help/index.html Getting Started>. In
% USRP-N2XX Net Burner GUI, for FPGA image you will provide generated 
% FPGA binary |usrp_n210_r4_fpga_mw.bin| (or |usrp_n210_r2_fpga_mw.bin|) 
% from project location like |hdl_prj\usrp_prj|. For Firmware image, you
% will use the original firmware (usrp_n210_fw_bin) since no changes are
% made to firmware during FPGA targetting.
%
%% Verify FPGA Implementation
% You can now open <matlab:sdruFMMonoFPGAretarget sdruFMMonoFPGAretarget>
%  model to verify your FPGA implementation of FM Mono Demodulator.
load_system('sdruFMMonoFPGAretarget')
open_system('sdruFMMonoFPGAretarget/FM Receiver')
%%
% You can quickly build the retarget model from the original sdruFMMonoFPGA
% model by removing the |FM_Demod_FPGA| subsystem along with Unbuffer/Buffer
% blocks and inserting the Complex to Real-Imag block. A few notes about
% the retarget model:
%
% * This model does not have FM Demodulator as that is implemented in FPGA.
% * The complex inputs received are converted into one 32 bit signed number
% with 29 fraction bits in order to match the output of the FM Demodulator
% (as modeled before in sdruFMMonoFPGA model). This is done by reusing the
% |Unpack FPGA outputs| subsystem from sdruFMMonoFPGA model.
% * The model operates in frame mode and buffering is disabled.
%
%% 
% You can run the model in real-time to listen the radio. The FPGA in the
% USRP(R) N210 hardware has been re-targeted with FM Demodulator. This
% concludes the example for targeting FM Demodulator on the FPGA.
