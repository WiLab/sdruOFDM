%% Overview
% Please refer to the <sdruFRSGMRSTx.html FRS/GMRS Walkie-Talkie
% Transmitter with USRP(R) Hardware> example for general information and
% overview details.  Note that all the information in that section applies
% to this example, except that this example is designed to receive signals
% instead of transmit them.


%% Structure of the Example
% This is the top-level block diagram of the model:
%%
open_system('sdruFRSGMRSRx');
set_param('sdruFRSGMRSRx', 'SimulationCommand', 'update');

%% Running the Example
% Turn on your walkie-talkie, set the channel to be one of the 14 channels
% (numbered 1 to 14) and the private code to be either one of the 38
% private codes (numbered 1 to 38) or 0, in which case no squelch system is
% used and all received messages are accepted.  Note that the private codes
% above 38 are digital codes and are not implemented in this example.
%
% Set the channel and private code in the |Model Parameters| GUI in 
% the model so that they match the settings on the walkie-talkie.  Run the 
% model, speak into the walkie-talkie, and see if you can hear your voice 
% come out of the computer speakers.  If not, try adjusting the 
% "Average signal threshold for squelch" parameter downward slightly.  You can change 
% the channel and private code without stopping and restarting the model.
%
% If you hear some dropouts or delay in the sound, run the model
% in Accelerator mode.  From the model menu, select 
% Simulation->Accelerator, then click the run button.  If you still
% experience dropouts or delay in Accelerator mode, try running the model
% in Rapid Accelerator mode.
%
% You can also run this model alongside an additional USRP(R) device
% running the FRS/GMRS transmitter example, instead of with a physical
% walkie-talkie.

%% FRS/GMRS Receiver Subsystem
% The |SDRu Receiver| block converts the RF waveform to complex baseband 
% samples, which become the input to this subsystem.  
%
% This subsystem is an enabled subsystem, which means that it is only
% active when the driving 'Data Len' output is greater than 0.
%
% Below is the block diagram of the |FRS-GMRS Receiver| subsystem:
%%
open_system('sdruFRSGMRSRx/FRS-GMRS Receiver/FRS-GMRS Receiver');

%% Automatic Gain Control
% The |Automatic Gain Control| block is the first block that processes the
% received signal. It processes the signal to ensure that the average
% magnitude of the samples is about 1.  In this case, the walkie-talkie
% transmitter is likely nearby the USRP(R) radio, which implies that the
% received signal should not suffer from fading, and the received noise
% should be low.  However, in general this may not be the case.
%

%% Channel Selectivity and FM Demodulation
% The channel selectivity filter is the next block.  If the incoming signal
% is from an adjacent channel, a low pass channel separation filter will
% reduce its power significantly.  The gap between adjacent channels is
% 25 kHz, which means the baseband bandwidth is at most 12.5 kHz. Thus, we
% choose the cutoff frequency to be 10 kHz.
%
% Next, a channel selector computes the average power of the filtered 
% signal, and if it is greater than a threshold (set to a default of 10%), 
% the channel selector determines that the received signal is from the
% correct channel and it allows the signal to pass through.  In the case of 
% an out-of-band signal, although the channel separation filter reduces its 
% magnitude, it is still FM modulated and the modulating signal will be 
% present after FM demodulation.  To reject such a signal completely, the 
% channel selector outputs zero.  
%
% The output goes into the |FM Demodulator| block, where a 
% simple differentiation operation performs the demodulation.

%%
open_system('sdruFRSGMRSRx/FRS-GMRS Receiver/FRS-GMRS Receiver/FM Demodulator');

%%
close_system('sdruFRSGMRSRx',0);

%%
% After FM demodulation, the |FIR Decimation| block converts the sampling
% rate to 200 kHz / 25 = 8 kHz.  This is one of the native sample rates of
% the audio device on your host computer.
%

%% Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) and Decision Block
% The CTCSS
% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System [3]>
% decoder computes the power at each CTCSS tone frequency using 
% the Goertzel algorithm 
% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm [4]>
% and outputs the code with the largest power into the |Decision| block.  
% The Goertzel algorithm is used because it provides an efficient method to 
% compute the frequency components at predetermined frequencies (namely, 
% the tone code frequencies used by FRS/GMRS).
%
% The |Decision| block compares the decoded code with a preselected code and
% sends the signal to the audio device if the two codes match. When the
% preselected code is zero, it indicates no squelch system is used and the
% decision block passes the signal at the channel to the audio device no
% matter which code is used.
%

%% Audio Output
% Before the audio device, a high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of
% 260 Hz is used to filter out the CTCSS tones (which have a maximum 
% frequency of 250 Hz) so that they are not heard.
%
% The |To Audio Device| block is set up by default to output to the current
% audio device in your system preferences.  

%% Exploring the Example
% The performance of the model may vary depending on the board that you
% use.  If your model does not produce any sound, you can vary the |Gain
% (dB)| parameter in the mask of the SDRu Receiver block.
%
% The CTCSS decoding computes the DTFT (Discrete-Time Fourier Transform) of
% the incoming signal using the Goertzel algorithm and computes the power
% at the tone frequencies.  Since the tone frequencies are very close to
% each other (only 3-4 Hz apart) the block length of the DTFT should be
% large enough to provide enough resolution for the frequency analysis.
% However, long block lengths cause decoding delay; for example, a block
% length of 16000 will cause 2 seconds of delay, since the CTCSS decoder
% operates at an 8 kHz sampling rate.  This creates a tradeoff between
% detection performance and processing latency. The optimal block length
% may depend on the quality of the transmitter and receiver, the distance
% between the transmitter and receiver, and other factors. You are
% encouraged to change the block length in the initialization function by
% navigating to the getParamsSdruFRSGMRSRxDemo function and changing the
% value of the FRSRxParams.DecodeBlockSize field.  This will enable you to
% observe the tradeoff and find the optimal value for your
% transmitter/receiver pair.
